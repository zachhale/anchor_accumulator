Ajax Anchor Watcher for Prototype
=================================

Lets you incrementally link to anchors that define query string parameters for sending to a url of choice and then updating an element with the contents.

Just include the ajax_anchor_watcher.js file with a script tag and attach one line to the load dom event as in the example.html.
